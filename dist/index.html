      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>BallerTV was founded in 2016 by Cramster co-founders Rob Angarita and Aaron Hawkey to
        provide live video coverage of amateur sports while creating sports media job opportunities
        in local communities. As of 2018, BallerTV is now a coast-to-coast operation with a network of
        thousands of broadcasters across the country. We're on track to broadcast our 100,100th game this year -
        and we're just getting started.
